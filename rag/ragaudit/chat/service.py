"""The chatbot.

Orchestrates: resolve the question against conversation history, route it,
answer it from the structured store or from retrieved narrative, verify every
citation against the evidence actually supplied, and attach any figures bound
to the findings involved.

Citation verification is the part that matters (D06). A model that cites a
chunk_id it was never shown, or quotes text that does not appear in the
evidence, has fabricated its grounding. Both are checked here, and a failed
check downgrades the answer rather than being logged and ignored.
